                    One of my favorite activities in the Rochester area is checking out the performing arts scene. We’re
                    incredibly lucky to have such beautiful theatres and a wealth of talented performers here in Upstate
                    New York. At least once a year, my best friend and I make it a point to see a show at Geva Theatre
                    in the city. While we often opt for familiar titles, we occasionally take a chance on something
                    lesser-known.

                    My first experience with Geva was in middle school during a field trip to see their annual
                    production of A Christmas Carol. That visit sparked my love for the theatre. With its intimate
                    lobby, charming bar and snack area, and the warm presence of welcoming docents, Geva makes a great
                    first impression. Despite the stage appearing modest in size, it’s remarkably versatile—and truly,
                    there’s not a bad seat in the house.

                    During my senior year of undergrad, a friend and I even had season tickets. It gave us a standing
                    outing every couple of months and introduced us to a mix of plays—some familiar, others completely
                    new. A Christmas Carol isn’t part of the season ticket package, but it’s absolutely worth seeing;
                    the dramatization changes each year, keeping the experience fresh.
