                Nick Tahou Hots is a Rochester, NY landmark restaurant famous for its Garbage Plate. The restaurant was
                founded by its namesake, Nick Tahou, who died in 1997 after running the establishment for over 50 years.
                Despite many regional variants all based on the same theme, Nick's is widely regarded as the original
                Garbage Plate.

                So I went there for my first
                    time after exploring the Rochester subway tunnels, and we had a nice dinner there. And as soon as
                    you enter, you’re definitely like, “yep, this is certainly the ‘trashy’ place for something like the
                    garbage plate would be found.”

            <div class="quote">
                There are a lot of stories around Nick Tahou’s, especially around its owner. Probably the most
                famous one is that they copyrighted the name garbage plate, so all the other places around that also
                served garbage plates had to name them slightly different.

                    So Nick Tahou’s is where the garbage plate initially started, and you kinda get the sense of that
                    being the case because it definitely feels like a place where the garbage plate would be invented.
                    That’s what I commonly heard from friends before I got to visit it. So I went there for my first
                    time after exploring the Rochester subway tunnels, and we had a nice dinner there. And as soon as
                    you enter, you’re definitely like, “yep, this is certainly the ‘trashy’ place for something like the
                    garbage plate would be found.”

                    There are a lot of stories around Nick Tahou’s, especially around its owner. Probably the most
                    famous one is that they copyrighted the name garbage plate, so all the other places around that also
                    served garbage plates had to name them slightly different. So I’ve seen trash plate, garbage heap,
                    garbage piles, trash fountains, garbage platters, so there are a lot of different interesting names
                    that different companies will try to come up with.

                <p>
                    I think at this point Nick Tahou’s has probably lost the name of being the best garbage plate place
                    in Rochester. It’s now a hotly debated topic, but there are still a certain number of people who
                    still view it as kind of the original place and who have a very big interest in it. Although I think
                    Nick might be trying to sell the store and leave, so how long it stays is anyone’s guess.
