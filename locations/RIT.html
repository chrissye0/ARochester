                    have to go to the specific storage closet, and if you do, you’ll be able to see murals that were put
                    up around 1970, so that’s about the time RIT came to this campus.

                    So Rochester Institute of Technology is certainly a place with a lot of different stories. So I have
                    been working on the RIT Iceberg, which is kind of a collection of different folklores, myths, and
                    stories for the last two years now, so I have a couple of good stories.
                </p>

                    The central statue in the middle of campus can control the weather. The best place to view the
                    statue is the president’s office, and so the president uses the Sentinel to make sure that we have
                    nice and sunny days for important events. If you go into the woods right outside Grace Watson Hall,
                    you can go visit the Crack Shack. There’s also a tunnel that goes into the sewers that is also in
                    the woods for some reason. There are many different secret staircases that lead out to weird doors.
                    There are also secret tunnel connections between the dorm side and academic side tunnels. Now, RIT
                    officially says that this is false, but a lot of our alumni I’ve talked to say that there are
                    actually service tunnels that go in between them, so the hunt is still on to actually find them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there’s a lot of small stuff that you might see - different stickers all around, QR codes,
                    graffiti, especially in the tunnels of academic side in between the Engineering and Liberal Arts
                    buildings. Those are places where you see a lot of student expression and a lot of very old murals.
                    Probably the oldest murals you can find are going to be in the residential dorm side tunnels. You
                    have to go to the specific storage closet, and if you do, you’ll be able to see murals that were put
                    up around 1970, so that’s about the time RIT came to this campus. So keep your eyes peeled whenever
                    you’re on campus and you never know what you might see.
