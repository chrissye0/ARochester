                Mount Hope Cemetery, one of the most remarkable Victorian cemeteries in America, is a magnificent 196
                acres of lofty hills and picturesque valleys created by glaciers and transformed into a beautiful
                historic cemetery. A diversified forest of trees forms an arboretum shading thousands of marble, bronze,
                and granite monuments. The cemetery is a veritable museum of funerary sculpture and mausoleums spanning
                more than a century and a half.

                    So it's kind of grim to think about walking around a cemetery, but Mount Hope Cemetery is one of the
                    really nicer places to stroll around Rochester. It's an Olmsted-designed park from the Victorian
                    rural cemetery movement. Of course, it's no longer rural because the city has since expanded, but
                    they needed to expand how they were taking care of bodies during the cholera epidemic. The older
                    side at least has the lovely rolling hills, a lot of, you know, curated paths through the gorgeous
                    sculpture that was typical of grave zones at that era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But a neat bit of history around that, so just maybe a couple blocks across the street is Highland
                    Park, which is the less grim option in terms of park strolling, also Olmsted designed. But the
                    Highland Park South used to be the site of a poorhouse, a jail, and I believe like a psych ward. And
                    again, this is the 19th century when people would die. They would sort of bury them just in this
                    potter's field out back. And then of course, eventually those buildings were razed and it was turned
                    into a park.

                    During park construction though, they discovered the mass burials in the back. And of course, they
                    have since interred a number of those graves into Mount Hope. So it kind of shows the contrasting
                    sort of death trends of the era where you have the sort of curated cemetery that people with more
                    money would have been able to access compared to the poor who were just sort of unceremoniously
                    thrown out back, but now they are interred properly in a cemetery, although I think they believe
                    there are still probably a number of undiscovered graves out in Highland Park South. So, you know, a
                    little, a little spookiness to both sides, but it's also reflective of the history at the time and
                    where Rochester fits in with all of that.
