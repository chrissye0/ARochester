            <p>
                Happy Earth Tea was established in 2011 by Niraj Lama and his wife Mary Boland. Niraj hails from
                Darjeeling, India – a region that produces some of world’s finest black teas. Before Happy Earth Tea,
                the family owned and operated Darjeeling Tea Exclusive based in Darjeeling. After the family resettled
                in the US, Darjeeling Tea Exclusive gave way to Happy Earth Tea. Happy Earth Tea is committed to
                curating some of the best organic teas found in the world.

                    Rochester is a pretty great cafe scene, but one place I particularly love is the Happy Earth Tea Bar
                    because it is a tea bar in that it just serves tea, different kinds of tea. The owner, Neeraj, he,
                    it's his own brand. He like actually has the connections with the various tea farms and tea
                    plantations across like Japan, Taiwan, China, India. And so he imports them all. And so you really
                    get a variety of tea that you wouldn't get otherwise just off the grocery store shelf, especially,
                    you know, we're getting into the level of like, oh, this is the first flush spring harvest. This is
                    the fall harvest. So you get this distinction that's not there with just green tea, black tea,
                    herbal teas. Also has probably the best masala chai in Rochester. He was originally from Darjeeling.
                    And not only is the tea great, of course, but it's also just a really nice vibe.

                    We moved into the same neighborhood around the same time. They were opening up shop and I just moved
                    down to that neighborhood. And there wasn't a tiny kind of hole in the wall spot. And we were there
                    like all the time. And they've finally upsized to a slightly larger space, which has been great
                    because so many more people can just come in and enjoy. You can sit at the bar, you can just get a
                    table, you can sit outside. And they offer like traditional, like either steeping or you can get it
                    a Kung Fu style. So just a lot of great options that you wouldn't otherwise find places. And if you
                    want that bar experience, but you don't want to drink alcohol, it's a great option. They do great
                    iced teas in the summer as well. So it's not just a hot drink option. Yeah, it's probably one of my
                    favorite Hangouts.
