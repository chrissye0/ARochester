                The Genesee Riverway Trail is a scenic multi-use trail which runs through Rochester from the Erie Canal
                to Lake Ontario. It is a designated National Recreational Trail, and connects to both the statewide Erie
                Canalway Trail and the Genesee Valley Greenway State Park.

                <p>
                    So Rattlesnake Point I think is one of my favorite places I’ve visited when I biked down the Genesee
                    Riverway Trail. So that is a trail that goes all the way from RIT to Lake Ontario, and I got the
                    privilege to bike the whole thing with my friend Wilson McDade a couple weeks ago. And if you ever
                    get the chance to bike down, it’s a really interesting mix. You get the full sense of what Rochester
                    is because you start in the kind of suburbs and the forests. You pass by some really cool graffiti
                    buildings, then you start getting into the city. You start to pass more buildings, you get into the
                    city, you pass by all the famous spots like High Falls, Kodak, Eastman, then you leave the city once
                    again and you’re by the lake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I think it’s a trail that really showcases all the different parts of Rochester, from the
                    surrounding forests and nature areas to the very industrial areas that got it founded. It also
                    passes by a lot of parks that you might not have ever seen. So, as I said, Rattlesnake Point is
                    something I didn’t even know existed until I had to bike through it. You also get to bike through a
                    dam at one point, and you get to bike through Charlotte. And Charlotte is a pretty beautiful city.
                    So it’s definitely something anyone interested in doing a nice beautiful hour bike ride should do.
