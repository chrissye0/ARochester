            <p>
                Genesee Country Village & Museum was founded in 1966 with the goal of preserving the architecture of the
                Genesee Valley region in a recreated historic village, providing context for the telling of New York
                State and 19th-century American history. The Museum now covers 600 acres and includes the Historic
                Village, the John L. Wehle Gallery, and the Genesee Country Nature Center, all of which provide
                interactive programs, fascinating exhibits, and special events to help you live and experience history.
            </p>
            <p>
                GCV&M is the largest and most comprehensive living history museum in New York State â€“ and the
                third-largest in the United States. Chartered as an educational institution by the NYS Board of Regents,
                the Museum offers opportunities to see, smell, taste, touch, explore, and experience our 68 historic
                buildings; more than 20,000 artifacts; wildlife paintings, drawings, and sculptures spanning centuries;
                the living collections in our gardens, on our working farm and at our Nature Center; and the gorgeous
                landscape that first brought settlers to this region.

                    I really love the Genesee Country Village and Museum. It's one of my favorite places in the
                    Rochester area. I've been visiting since I was in elementary school. It's just a really special
                    place for me. There's always something new to explore. If you love history, or especially if you
                    love historical fashion, which is something I really love, it's an incredibly fun place to visit.

                    My favorite time to visit is in the summer. I've worn Regency clothing before, even though I'm not
                    an official reenactor it's really fun to do. I'll usually bring a friend and we'll buy ice cream and
                    19th century candies and we'll just kind of wander the streets pretending like we're in the
                    Victorian era.

                    The Spirits of the Past event is super fun. It's really spooky and creative and every year there's a
                    different theme. It happens around Halloween and I definitely recommend this event. Overall, I just
                    really love the Genesee Country Village and Museum.
